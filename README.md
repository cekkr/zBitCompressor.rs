# zBitCompressor.rs

**zBit is an experimental bits-to-Karnaugh-map circuits compression algorithm.**

Its central peculiarity is that it does not only look at a file as a linear sequence of bytes. It also tries to treat the file as a Boolean landscape: bits, positions, symbols, chunks, frame payloads, corrections, and transformed ranges can become cells in a Karnaugh-like map. When regions of that map can be grouped, simplified, linked, or represented as circuits with less metadata than the original bytes, zBit can store the circuit/structure instead of storing the data literally.

In a classic compressor, the main question is often: **"which previous byte sequence or symbol distribution can describe this sequence cheaply?"** In zBit, the deeper question is: **"which Boolean/circuit structure explains these bits cheaply, and is the explanation smaller than the raw data plus corrections?"**

This makes zBit closer to an adaptive structural compressor than to a single fixed codec. The current Rust implementation combines exact Boolean minimization, heuristic cover refinement, SAT-assisted local pruning, canonical circuit DAGs, adaptive byte packing, recursive transform topology, and chunked stream grouping. The packer is intentionally conservative: circuit modeling is used only when the model, dictionary, references, and residual corrections beat simpler representations.

## The Peculiarity: Compression by Boolean Structure

The conceptual model is:

```text
file bytes -> bit/position/context map -> Karnaugh-like groups -> simplified circuits -> encoded structure + residual corrections
```

A Karnaugh map groups adjacent equal Boolean outputs so they can be represented by fewer literals. zBit generalizes that idea beyond the small classroom grid:

- **cells** can be individual bits, byte-symbol rows, chunk ranges, transformed positions, framed payload bytes, correction bytes, or stream pieces;
- **ON/OFF/DC sets** describe what must evaluate to `1`, what must remain `0`, and what may be ignored or corrected elsewhere;
- **cubes / implicants** are generalized K-map groups over many dimensions;
- **circuits** are executable descriptions of these groups and relations;
- **compression wins** only when the structural explanation is smaller than the literal bytes.

The algorithm is therefore not simply "find repeated bytes". A useful pattern may be a Boolean relation, a reusable circuit slice, a transformed residual, a monotonic integer stream, a framed-data reconstruction plan, a global stream slice, or a conventional entropy/codec candidate if that is actually smaller.

## Why This Is Different from Classic Compression

| Classic compression tendency | zBit structural/circuit tendency |
| --- | --- |
| Search repeated substrings, dictionaries, or symbol probabilities. | Search Boolean regions, circuit covers, transform topology, reusable slices, and candidate pack structures. |
| Treat data mainly as a byte stream. | Treat data as bytes **and** as bit-level maps over positions, contexts, chunks, and reversible transforms. |
| A match is usually a previous sequence or statistical code. | A match can be a simplified circuit, a cube cover, a frame reconstruction rule, a correction plan, or a stream/global slice. |
| One dominant codec strategy is applied to the whole input or block. | Many reversible representations compete; the smallest validated candidate is selected. |
| Good entropy coding can hide local redundancy. | zBit tries to expose deeper logical structure before choosing how to encode it. |

This is why the project should be read as a **bits-to-Karnaugh-map-to-circuits compressor**: the Boolean/circuit view is the distinctive research direction, while the adaptive packer makes the approach usable on real files without forcing circuits where they are not economical.

## Algorithm Narrative

At a high level, zBit works like a structural search engine for reversible explanations of data:

1. **Map the data into candidate spaces.** The same input may be seen as raw bytes, indexed symbols, small truth tables, frame payloads, transformed ranges, stream chunks, or correction streams.
2. **Find compressible Boolean regions.** For bounded truth-table problems, exact minimization builds implicants like K-map groups. For larger inputs, heuristic and SAT-assisted passes try cheaper local improvements.
3. **Build or reuse circuit-like descriptions.** Canonical nodes, recursive transform nodes, group nodes, and global slices represent structure that can be serialized and later decoded deterministically.
4. **Estimate total cost, not elegance.** A beautiful circuit is rejected if its metadata is larger than raw bytes or a conventional codec candidate.
5. **Validate roundtrip reconstruction.** Every selected representation must decode back to the exact original bytes.

The long-term development direction is a stronger **Circuit Atlas**: a cacheable dictionary of reusable circuits/slices that can link distant and apparently unrelated parts of a file or stream when they share hidden Boolean structure. The current code already contains foundations for that direction through canonical models, adaptive candidates, recursive topology metadata, stream grouping, and global-slice references.

## Scope

This repository currently contains:

- `zbit-rs/`: the active Rust crate
- `papers/`: theory and implementation-guidance documents

The implementation is intentionally aligned with the paper guidance that exact methods are valuable for bounded local problems, while practical compression needs representation-aware heuristics and strict validation.

## Theory -> Implementation Mapping

### 1. Exact two-level minimization in bounded scope

Paper guidance: exact minimization is strongest on small support functions and should be bounded.

Implemented:

- Quine-McCluskey style prime implicant generation
- exact minimum cover selection with branch-and-bound search
- don't-care support in minimization
- hard exact limit: `ZBIT_MAX_INPUTS_EXACT = 16`

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/minimizer.rs`
- `zbit-rs/src/model.rs`

### 2. Canonical structural representation + rewrite-ready flow

Paper guidance: representation choice matters.

Implemented:

- canonical node interning (`Pin`, `Not`, `And`, `Or`, `Xor`)
- commutative normalization and simplification rules
- deterministic serialized model format (`.zbit`)
- advanced rewrite flow with:
  - graph-style resubstitution (absorbed-term elimination)
  - AIG-like consensus merges (local rewriting)
  - balancing-aware objective estimation

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/model.rs`
- `zbit-rs/src/advanced.rs`

### 3. Espresso-style iterative cover heuristics

Paper guidance: large search spaces need iterative heuristic improvements in addition to exact bounded methods.

Implemented:

- iterative expand/select loop inspired by Espresso-style cover refinement
- legal expansion under ON+DC constraints
- greedy objective-aware cube selection and irredundancy cleanup

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/advanced.rs`

### 4. SAT-assisted local exactness

Paper guidance: SAT is useful as a bounded local oracle inside larger heuristic flows.

Implemented:

- lightweight CNF SAT solver (DPLL with unit propagation)
- SAT-driven local redundancy pruning for cubes in a candidate cover
- bounded SAT window control (`sat_local_exact_inputs`)

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/sat.rs`
- `zbit-rs/src/advanced.rs`

### 5. Technology-aware mapping objectives

Paper guidance: objective function must match target technology, not just literal count.

Implemented:

- objective-aware scoring for:
  - literal minimization
  - ASIC area proxy
  - ASIC delay proxy
  - FPGA LUT4/LUT6 proxies
- advanced model entrypoints with explicit objective selection

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/advanced.rs`
- `zbit-rs/src/model.rs`

### 6. Representation-aware adaptive packing

Paper guidance: choose method by objective/cost, avoid one fixed algorithm worldview.

Implemented:

- adaptive selection among:
  - `raw-copy`
  - `indexed-raw`
  - `indexed-circuit`
  - `indexed-huffman`
  - `raw-deflate`
  - `raw-zstd`
- rule-based gating for circuit-dictionary evaluation
- size-based final method choice, never worse than raw baseline by design
- strict `.zbpk` parser validation

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/pack/`
- `zbit-rs/src/pack_rules.rs`

### 7. Streaming compression with multi-level grouping

Implemented:

- `.zbps` chunk-stream container with key-piece intervals for restartable decode
- per-chunk/per-group adaptive selection with configurable multi-level grouping depth
- deterministic block boundaries so receivers can start decode from key pieces without replaying full history
- optional grouping-history hints in block headers for sharing generalized grouping strategy over time
- optional shared-grouping payload layer in non-wide realtime mode, so blocks can reference global generalized circuits/slices when local piece compression is weaker

Code:

- `zbit-rs/src/pack/`
- `zbit-rs/src/bin/benchmark_stream_real_file.rs`

### 8. Validation and benchmark as first-class workflow

Paper guidance: implementation quality requires verification + measurement loops.

Implemented:

- unit + integration tests for:
  - exact minimization
  - Espresso-style heuristic optimization
  - SAT local pruning
  - objective-aware advanced compression
  - model and pack roundtrip validation
- benchmark binary with method rationale, candidate sizes, timings, throughput, ratio, and output validation

Code:

- `zbit-rs/tests/`
- `zbit-rs/src/bin/benchmark_real_file.rs`
